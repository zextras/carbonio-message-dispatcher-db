## How to Build üîß

To build artifacts locally, run the `build-artifacts.sh` script. You'll need
docker installed locally.

## How to install üèÅ

### Preparing the environment

- Install PostgreSQL: `apt install postgresql`
- Create a `postgres` superuser:

  ```bash
  # sudo -u postgres psql
  # CREATE ROLE "carbonio_adm" WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER encrypted password
  'your-secret-password';
  # \q
  ```

### Installation

Install `carbonio-message-dispatcher-db` via apt:

```bash
sudo apt install carbonio-message-dispatcher-db
```

or via yum:

 ```bash
sudo yum install carbonio-message-dispatcher-db
```

### Configuration

In order to make it work with external databases the
`carbonio-message-dispatcher-db.hcl`
**MUST** be manually
updated by changing the address from `127.0.0.1` to the remote address. To
finalize the
configuration:

- Execute `pending-setups` in order to register the service in
  the `service-discover`
- Bootstrap the Message Dispatcher database:

  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=your-secret-password carbonio-message-dispatcher-db-bootstrap
  carbonio_adm 127.0.0.1
  ```

If the bootstrap script is executed multiple times it reuses the credentials
created the first time and stored in `service-discover`.

### Reading config values

All the necessary configurations are saved automatically in
the `service-discover` configuration
system. They can be retrieved with the following commands:

- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/message-dispatcher/service-discover
  /token" "carbonio-message-dispatcher-db/db-name"`
- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/message-dispatcher/service-discover
  /token" "carbonio-message-dispatcher-db/db-username"`
- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/message-dispatcher/service-discover
  /token" "carbonio-message-dispatcher-db/db-password"`
